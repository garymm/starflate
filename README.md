Deflate on GPU

## Set up

Should work on Linux and MacOS.

* Install `bazel` or `bazelisk`

* Verify that you can build and test:
```sh
bazel test //...
```

### VS Code

Install the recommended extensions. See .vscode/extensions.json.

### Auto-completion

Create a compilation database:

```sh
bazel build //... && bazel run @hedron_compile_commands//:refresh_all
```

Then configure [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/).
If you're using VS Code, the .vscode/settings does this for you,
and .vscode/extensions.json already recommends installing the clangd extension.

Otherwise, copy the clangd args from the [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json).

## Status

### Done

* Build Huffman code tables from given symbol frequencies.
* Huffman decoding with C++ std lib.

### TODO

* Get SYCL building with bazel. Already have OpenSYCL building for CPU only [here](https://github.com/garymm/xpu).
  Would be nicer to use [intel's LLVM](https://github.com/intel/llvm) which supports lots of GPUs.
* (maybe?) Implement LZ77 with C++ std lib.
* Implement Deflate decompression with C++ std lib.
* Port Deflate to SYCL.
* Benchmark it on CPU.
* Build system work to get it to run on GPU.
* Benchmark it on GPU.
